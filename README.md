## Quick Start

modReflexes automatically adds the Reflex Blast skill to your skill tree as you load a save file. Witcher Reflex doesn't need to install anything to your skill tree and will be ready to go right away.  

1. Copy ```modReflexes``` to ```<Witcher3 Install>\Mods```
2. Copy ```modReflexes\bin``` to ```<Witcher3 Install>```
3. Load any save file  
4. Open your ```Character``` page  
5. Add skill points to ```Reflex Blast```  
6. Activate the skill (requires ```Aard Sweep``` activated as well)  
7. When in combat, by default, you can expend 2 adrenaline points
